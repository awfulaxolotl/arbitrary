# Arbitrary

Generate arbitrary data with control. This isn't your normal random data generation:

* **Not random.** Generates arbitrary data from numbers. Give the same number; get the same data
* **Preserves locality.** Give it closer numbers? Get similar data. Give it numbers further apart? Get different data.

This added control makes it a great foundation for advanced development and testing tools.
